[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.1-blue.svg)](https://github.com/matvei77/claude-ai-downloader)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Chrome Extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/chrome-extension-orange.svg)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/)

A Chrome extension that exports Claude.ai conversations to markdown files with full context: messages, artifacts, attachments, and code blocks.

## Features

- **Complete Message Export** - Captures all human messages and Claude responses
- **Artifact Extraction** - Exports all code blocks, components, and artifacts
- **Attachment Support** - Includes uploaded files and their content
- **Structured Output** - Clean markdown format with references and full context
- **Privacy-First** - All processing happens locally, no data sent anywhere

## Installation

### Step 1: Generate Icons
1. Open `icons/generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click "Download All Icons"
3. Save the three PNG files to the `icons/` directory

Required icon files:
- `icon16.png` (16x16px)
- `icon48.png` (48x48px)
- `icon128.png` (128x128px)

### Step 2: Load Extension in Chrome
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the project folder
5. Extension icon should appear in your browser toolbar

## Usage

1. Navigate to https://claude.ai and open a conversation
2. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
3. Click "Export Conversation"
4. Wait for processing to complete
5. Save the downloaded markdown file

## Output Format

The exported markdown file contains:

### Section 1: Conversation Flow
- All messages in chronological order
- References to artifacts and attachments
- Clean, readable format

### Section 2: Context (Full Content)
- Complete artifact code with syntax highlighting
- Full attachment content
- Structured with anchor links from the conversation

## How It Works

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`) - Runs on Claude.ai pages
   - Extracts Claude responses directly from DOM
   - Extracts messages via edit button simulation
   - Scans DOM for artifacts and attachments
   - Checks localStorage for additional content

2. **Background Worker** (`background.js`) - Handles file downloads
   - Converts markdown to downloadable file
   - Uses Chrome downloads API

3. **Popup UI** (`popup.html`) - Triggers the export
   - Simple button interface
   - Shows export status
   - Communicates with content script

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't appear after loading
- Make sure you selected the correct folder
- Check that all files are present
- Look for errors in `chrome://extensions/`

### Export button does nothing
- Make sure you're on a Claude.ai conversation page
- Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- Try reloading the Claude.ai page

### Some content is missing from export
- First: Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/` and try again
- The extension relies on Claude's DOM structure
- If Claude updates their UI, selectors may need updating
- Check console for warnings about failed extractions
- Try clicking the export button while the page is fully loaded

### Download doesn't start
- Check that the extension has "downloads" permission
- Look for errors in the extension's service worker console
- Try clicking the export button again

## Debugging

### View Content Script Logs
1. Open Claude.ai conversation

4. Look for export-related messages

### View Background Script Logs
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Claude Conversation Exporter"
3. Click "service worker" link
4. Console logs will appear

### View Popup Logs

## Known Limitations

- **DOM Selectors**: Claude may update their UI, breaking selectors
- **Large Conversations**: Very long conversations may take longer to process
- **Image Downloads**: Only captures image URLs, not the actual image files
- **Real-time Updates**: Must click export button; doesn't auto-export
- **Formatting**: Some special formatting in Claude's responses may not be preserved perfectly

## Privacy & Security

- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- No tracking or analytics
- Open source - inspect the code yourself
- Only requests minimal required permissions

## Permissions Explained

- **activeTab** - Access current Claude.ai page to read conversation
- **downloads** - Save markdown file to your computer
- **storage** - (Optional) Save user preferences
- **host_permissions** - Only works on claude.ai domains
